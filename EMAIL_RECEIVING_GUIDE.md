# Real Email Receiving Setup Guide

## Requirements for Real Email Receiving:

### 1. Domain Setup

- Buy a real domain (e.g., mytempmail.com)
- Configure DNS MX records to point to your server
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

### 2. Email Server Setup

- Install and configure Postfix/Dovecot
- Set up email routing
- Configure anti-spam measures

### 3. Alternative: Use Email Service Providers

- Mailgun (has inbound email API)
- SendGrid (inbound parse webhook)
- AWS SES (can receive emails)

### 4. Code Changes Needed

- SMTP server to receive emails
- Webhook handlers for incoming emails
- Real-time email processing
- Domain validation

## Current System Status:

✅ Perfect for development and learning
✅ SMTP sending works (Gmail integration)
✅ Web interface complete
✅ Database integration working

## Recommendation:

Keep current system for now - it demonstrates all core concepts
of a TempMail service without complex infrastructure requirements.

If you want real email receiving later, consider using:

- Mailgun Inbound Email API
- SendGrid Inbound Parse Webhook
- AWS SES Email Receiving
